This project was to build a 3 tier CMS using php. The Database for this assignment is gone, 
making it not very useful to run however you will get an Idea of my skills with PHP from looking at the code. 
We used PHP Storm in the creation of this assignment. we were given the Java Script portion of the assignment, 
that code is not ours.
